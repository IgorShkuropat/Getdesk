1.5 screen layout

In this prodject i'm used BEM(needs improvement) and SCSS. That layout was made for desktop, not adapted for mobile devices.

Also i tried to make custom checkbox, but on stage, where when input becomes checked and display: none; checkmark should change to display: block; something breaks and when it clicked checkmark does not appear. I guess this is due to a mistake with selectors
"& input: checked .form__checkbox + img"

Also when i open this page on live server all works fine, but when i open index.html withount live server all images just not displayed, i don't know why.
